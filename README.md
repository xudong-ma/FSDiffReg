## Requirements
Please use command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install the environment. We used PyTorch 1.12.0, Python 3.8.10 for training.

## Data
* We used 3D cardiac MR images for training: [ACDC dataset](https://acdc.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/description/databases.html)

## Training

To run training process:

```
python train.py -c config/train_3D.json
```

## Test

To run testing process:

```
python test.py -c config/test_3D.json -w [YOUR TRAINED WEIGHTS] -note [test_trans ... to remind myself what this test is on]
```
